- 👋 Hi, I’m Jake Abed (@jake-abed)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Video Games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually anything, but I'd love to work on creating software to help nerdy people,
-     small businesses, non-profits, and potentially teachers. I'm open to anything.
