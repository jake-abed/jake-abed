- 👋 Hi, I’m Jake Abed (@jake-abed)
- 🌱 I’m work primarily in JS/TS, Elixir/Phoenix, Node.js, Deno, and Fresh.
- 🎮 My game engine of choice is Godot 4.x, but I'm also familiar with Gamemaker and Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually anything, but I'd love to work on creating software to help nerdy people, small businesses, non-profits, and potentially teachers. I'm open to anything.
