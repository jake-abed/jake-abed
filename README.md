- 👋 Hi, I’m Jake Abed (@jake-abed)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Video Games
- 🌱 I’m work primarily in JS/TS, Node.js, Deno, and Fresh.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtually anything, but I'd love to work on creating software to help nerdy people, small businesses, non-profits, and potentially teachers. I'm open to anything.

My Learning To-Do List:
- Elixir: Functional programming is super cool! Elixir also has the coolest logo.
- How To Build Compilers: Enough said. Love the nitty gritty.
- Godot: This engine seems exciting, extensible, and flexible. Who doesn't love Open Source either.
